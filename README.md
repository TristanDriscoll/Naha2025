This Manuscript Describes a Dextran Vinyl Sulfone hydrogel system that allows for presentation of specific ECM ligands.  It includes data for characterization of the gel system as well as 2D and 3D experiments to test the impact of specific integrin binding domains of fibronectin and laminin.

Abstract
Degenerative disc disease is strongly associated with low back pain, making it a leading
cause of disability. With injury and age, cellular remodeling of the disc tissue leads to
compositional changes, stiffening, and loss of stress relaxation, particularly in the central
gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP) region of the disc. As part of this extracellular matrix (ECM)
remodeling, there is an increase in the deposition of fibronectin, a strongly adhesive integrin ligand
that is known to regulate inflammatory signaling. However, it is unclear how these pathological
changes in cellular adhesion regulate cell phenotype, and which domains of fibronectin are
specifically involved. Here, we employ a dextran vinyl sulfone (DexVS) hydrogel system for
presentation of specific fibronectin domains. We find that fibronectin peptides enhance fibrotic
signaling (YAP/TAZ pathway), inflammatory signaling (NF-ÎºB pathway), cellular adhesion, and
cellular contractility. This leads to a decrease in sulfated glycosaminoglycan production (sGAG)
and activation of fibrotic and inflammatory gene expression. Conjugation of bioactive peptides
into this hydrogel system also allows for targeted interactions with specific integrin receptors that
are involved in healthy or degenerative signaling. In doing so, we have identified the synergy site
within fibronectin as an important regulator of the fibrotic phenotype in NP cells.
